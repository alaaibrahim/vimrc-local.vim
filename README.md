vimrc-local
===========

If you are looking here I suggest you take a look at [https://github.com/vim-scripts/local_vimrc.vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/local_vimrc.vim)

I'm just implementing a simple version here, and only because local_vimrc has some problems with [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)

A plugin that looks for a local version of .vimrc.local, if it finds it will load it.
it also looks for a .vimrc.local in the git root
